1. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE
Welcome to our company.

This document explains how we work together, how we treat each other, and what everyone can expect from the company and from one another. These policies are not written to control people. They are written to support people, protect dignity, and create a safe, fair, and positive workplace.

We believe a company grows only when its people grow. So these policies focus on respect, honesty, work life balance, learning, and long term stability. Every rule here applies equally to everyone, including the owner and leadership team. No one is above these policies.

This policy document follows Indian laws and Gujarat state rules that apply to MSME companies. Wherever the law gives minimum standards, we aim to meet or exceed them in a practical and human way.

If any part of this policy feels unclear, employees are always encouraged to ask questions. Silence and fear have no place here. Open conversation is always welcome.
