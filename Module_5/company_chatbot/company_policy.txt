1. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE

This policy document explains how our company works and how we treat each other. It exists to create clarity, fairness, and trust. It is not written to control people. It is written to support people.

Every organisation needs shared rules so that everyone knows what is right, what is expected, and what support is available. Clear policies reduce confusion. Fair policies reduce fear. Human policies build long-term relationships.

Our company believes that work should not damage dignity, health, or personal life. Work should provide income, learning, and stability. People should feel safe, respected, and heard.
